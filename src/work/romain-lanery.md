workDescription: This work was done as part of a challenge by the French Tech Youtuber Romain Lanery. The goal was to create a heroic character thanks to tools like Photoshop from a "simple image". Our character will be compared to designers from Fiverr (5€ vs 1.000€ photo retouching). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYFCxMVZMRg">Click me to see the video.</a> He made a reaction video <a href="https://youtu.be/XKKg0xQ7-kI?t=424">(Click on me to see his reaction)</a>
